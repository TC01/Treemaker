# Optional, defaults to False. Cannot be overridden on the command line
# (Because overriding a boolean doesn't quite make sense).

# Optional, mutually exclusive parameters:
# How many jobs do you want to run at once?
# VERSUS
# How many fractional jobs do you want to create?
# Example: 1000 files. split_into = 300 makes 4 jobs {300, 300, 300, 100}.
# split_by = 5 makes five jobs {200, 200, 200, 200, 200}.
